# Contribution guide

## Contributing to this project
We are currently at the beginning of our project, and as such, our team will be fairly small until we have final confirmation to begin sanctioned work. This project is driven by students of Evergreen Valley Community College for the students of the college.

Although we may not be looking for contributions at this current stage, we may at a later time.

## Current Contributors
This file will be updated with a formal guide on how our code should look. We will be using Android Studio and Java, so please spend some time getting familiar with the tools. The code style guide may be placed in a separate file.
